# SP_Final_Project_E
Repository to upload and update the work done on the SP Final Project

## Process:
- Data cleaning and processing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Normalization and correlation
- Modeling and classification
- Validation
- API designing
- API deployment

## Structure of the repository
- `docs`: folder where the necessary documentation to evaluate this project is stored.
- `data`: folder where data is stored after each stage.
- `notebooks`: folder where different notebooks explain all the processes, decisions and assumptions made during data processing, exploratory analysis, normalization and feature extraction, and classification model designing.
- `src`: folder with auxiliar functions that are used in the notebooks and in the API designing. It works as a library.
- `models`: folder with that contains the generated model that is used to classify input patinets in the API.
- `api`: api designing code and a test to validate the correctness of the design.
- `requirements.txt`: execute this file to install all the necessary libraries that are used during the project.
