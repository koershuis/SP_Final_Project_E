## Objective of the project

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate predictive model to assess the risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) over a ten-year period, based on specific clinical markers and patient demographics. Using a dataset comprising relevant health features such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and glucose, the study implements a complete data science pipeline involving data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering. Machine learning algorithms are trained, optimized, and validated to identify the most effective classification approach. To ensure practical applicability, the final model is encapsulated within a functional API and containerized using Docker, providing a scalable, accessible solution for potential diagnostic support.

## Distribution of tasks

The workload has been distributed equally among the seven group members. Contributor 1 was responsible for the initial data cleaning and summary, managing missing values, discarding irrelevant variables, and generating the first statistical overview through histograms and boxplots. Contributor 2 focused on data aggregation and visualization, developing functions to group key categories and creating scatterplots to analyze relationships between variables such as blood pressure and BMI. Contributor 3 handled data normalization—using techniques like z-score or min-max scaling—and conducted correlation analyses to eliminate redundant features.

The predictive engine was built by Contributor 4, who implemented classification models such as KNN or Random Forest to identify high-risk patients. This was followed by Contributor 5, who established the validation strategy, selected the best-performing model, and designed the initial API schema. Contributor 6 then finalized the API by developing functional endpoints, integrating the trained model, and adding technical documentation. Finally, Contributor 7 managed the deployment phase by containerizing the application with Docker and hosting the API on a cloud server. To conclude the project, the entire team collaborated on refining the final model, drafting the comprehensive technical report, and producing a demonstration video of the live deployment.
